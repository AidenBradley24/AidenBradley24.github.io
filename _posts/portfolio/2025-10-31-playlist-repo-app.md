Store your media in a system like GIT.

Host, download, query, and manage your media with one system. Use yt-dlp to download media playlists from various platforms like YouTube. Then combine them into a local database and media server.

Designed to completely replace and combine the functionality of my previous YTAutoMusic and Local Playlist Master.
