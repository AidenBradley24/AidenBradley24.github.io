I decided to learn React.js by creating a card engine. It consists of a collection of tools and components that can be used to create a variety of different card games.

The first game I built was Blackjack using a fake currency. I thought it would be any easy project, but it turned out there were many aspects I didn't consider. The hardest thing to implement was the splitting functionality. Solving that consisted of treating each hand as a seperate player and then simply adding a 'player' when the player splits their hand into two.

I plan on adding more games in the future like go-fish or capitialism. Perhaps I will even figure out how to do multiplayer. We will see.
