Echo island was my Senior Capstone for my Bachelors degree in Computer Science.

It is a text-based game that utilizes an LLM to enhance interactablility.

## Synopsis

Echo Island is a magical miniature island. Upon arriving at the island, the terrain changes to project the mind of the main character, protecting itself and the artifact in the process. The inhabitants are somewhat wary of the MC and attempt to stop them. Some may help along the way.

Echo Island begins with the worldbuilding survey. The artifact, powered by the Llama 3 based LLM Hermes 3, learns about the MC and builds a database of locations and character classes. These are used during gameplay to generate encounters the MC experiences during their adventure to reach the artifact.
