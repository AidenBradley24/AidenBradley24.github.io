This project was built off of another project I worked on last year called [YTAutoMusic](https://github.com/AidenBradley24/YTAutoMusic). It was a CLI application, and I felt like I needed a bit more experience with GUIs. I also learned a lot of the basics of databases as Local Playlist Master uses SQLite.
