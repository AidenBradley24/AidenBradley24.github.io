I created a game called Squirrel Launcher. It was one of my favorite projects. It is developed using the Unity Game Engine and the C# programming language.
The goal of the game is to launch squirrels into the air and upgrade their equipment to get further and further. It currently has very positive ratings on Steam.

# What the game is about

Squirrel Launcher is a game about launching squirrels into space. It is based on games like Learn 2 Fly, so the main goal is to get further and further until the squirrels make it to the moon. Every level contains obstacles that the player must overcome, or they take damage.

There are 5 levels:

### Forest

Originally called the Grasslands back in beta, this level you launch the squirrel out of a cannon. Later you can unlock the glider which will allow the you to steer the flight.

### Desert

After finishing the forest level, the player flies an airplane across a South-West America style desert. This level represents a significant difficulty spike, and as a result, many players drop off. In retrospective, the level should have been made a little bit easier. The level introduces the engine and fuel, which allow the plane to travel further than normal. There are also now powerups and new obstacles to overcome.

### Ocean

This level is set on a stormy night in the middle of an ocean. It introduces a gun that can shoot down obstacles. This is basically a prelude to the fourth level and is not supposed to take long.

### The Moon (Space)

The original last level. It is now time for the squirrel to get launched into space as advertised. This level takes about 4x the amount of time and effort as the previous levels. It introduces many new gameplay elements.

### The Return (Space)

The last level, around the same length as the moon level. It was added to the game a year after the original steam release. It contains a new mechanic with managing a resource to repair the spaceship and fire missles. It also contains a boss fight which took way too long to design.
