Outside of the games I've made on Scratch, this is thing I've ever published. It is a dungeon-crawler game with procedurally generated levels. I ended up designing my own algorithm to generate the levels. It is built using C# and the Unity Game Engine.

There are many environments and bosses to take down. I'll warn you though, it was not properly balanced so it may be hard!

I've been wanting to remake this game for a while with all the things I've learned taken into account. But with the recent Unity controversy, and the fact that I should get experience in other areas of computer science, I probably won't.
